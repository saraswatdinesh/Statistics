**Case 1 ->**

The pursuit of a higher education degree in business is now international. A survey shows that more and more Asians choose the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree route to corporate success. As a result, 
the number of applicants for MBA courses at Asia-Pacific schools continues to increase. Across the region, thousands of Asians show an increasing willingness to temporarily shelve their careers and spend two years 
pursuing a theoretical business qualification. Courses in these schools are notoriously tough and include economics, banking, marketing, behavioral sciences, labor relations, decision-making, strategic thinking, 
business law, and more. The data set BAN_602_Case_1 shows some of the characteristics of the leading Asia-Pacific business schools.

Questions to be answered -
1. Include a summary (mean, median, standard deviation, variance, range, and interquartile range) for each quantitative variable in the dataset. Use a table to display the quantitative variables' summary measures in one place.
What insights do these descriptive statistics provide regarding the Asia-Pacific business schools? 
2. Summarize the data to compare the following:
  a. Mean differences between domestic and foreign tuition for schools requiring versus not requiring a GMAT. 
  b. Any difference between mean starting salaries for schools requiring versus not requiring work experience.
  c. Any difference between mean starting salaries for schools requiring versus not requiring English tests. 
3. Does the starting salary appear to be related to domestic tuition? Does starting salary appear to be associated with foreign tuition? Justify using both visual and numerical measures.
4. Draw a boxplot to summarize the starting salary data graphically. Identify the first, second, and third quartiles from the boxplot. Are there any outliers?

Approach ->

Processed the data using the R and get the mean, median, IQR, variance, range, and outliers. 
Calculate the mean difference between the schools requiring GMAT or not and domestic versus foreign tuition. Use the tabular approach to reveal more insights. 
Calculate the mean difference in the starting salaries among the schools requiring work exp vs not
Calculate the mean difference among the schools that require English tests vs those that do not require them. 


Get the correlation coefficient to check if we have any relation between the starting salary wrt to domestic tuition cost. Is it associated with foreign tuition or not? Draw the scatter plot of starting salary vs domestic 
tuition and foreign tuition. It should follow some mathematical trend 
on the X-axis and Y-axis. 


Draw the boxplot to identify the outlier data points that fall after the 1.5 times the IQR.

Refer to the Word document for the detailed report. ( Please note we have used the formula to calculate the population mean however we should have used the default formula for the mean value calculation as 
it is the entire population in contention of the scope of the problem)
